<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello My self <b>Sanika Daithankar</b> from Aurangabad currently pursuing BTech in IT from Government College of 
  Engineering, Aurangabad. I'm in 3rd year now. I've done my schooling from Agrasen vidya mandir, Aurangabad 
  till 10th std, passed out in 2019 and then joined Narayana Institute for 11th and 12th to prepare for 
  JEE Mains and Advance. Unfortunately things didn't worked well, there was Covid-19 outbreak in 2020 and lockdown 
  happened in March, 2020. As a result everyone had to sit at home and do work from home. Henceforth I didn't got 
  a desired percentile in JEE mains and was not qualified for JEE adv. So I shifted my focus from JEE to MHT-CET.
  I always wanted to go to Pune for Engineering, but that didn't happened. I got 95 percentile and got Govt. 
  college of Engineering, A'bad.<br/>
  My hobbies are drawing, listening music and watch new movies. I used to oftenly draw in my school days but now 
  due to lack of time and other things I don't draw frequently. Besides that I loved to dance but feels sad to 
  say that I can't dance properly, but again I'll one day. In school time I used be shy, the one who used to talk 
  with there own people, little unconfident. But now I love to interact with different people, know there thoughts 
  and ideas.<br/>
  Being an engineering student I'm exploring different things, different areas. First and Second year of my college 
  went like so quick. Now I'm in third year and I feel like this will be a very important year. I should make the 
  most out of it. I have to polish my skills, grab new skills and pratice and pratice more.
